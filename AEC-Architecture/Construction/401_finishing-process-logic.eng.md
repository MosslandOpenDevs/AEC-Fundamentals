# From Invisible to Visible

### Finishing Process as an Invisible Layer

</div>

---

<br>

Buildings are not just concrete masses. They are precise systems of layered functions with strict dependencies.  
Post-structure finishing defines <strong>physical performance (insulation, airtightness, waterproofing)</strong> and the <strong>user-facing interface (visual finish)</strong>.

---

## 1. Process Flow: Dependency & Sequence

Finishing flows from <strong>functional essential layers</strong> to <strong>visual surface layers</strong>.  
This sequence cannot be reversed, and the quality of earlier steps directly affects downstream integrity.

### Phase 1. Waterproofing: The Invisible Shield
Installed first, but ultimately hidden. It forms the base logic that prevents water intrusion into the structure.

* <strong>[Location]</strong> Wet areas (toilets, balconies, roofs) at floor and wall bases.
* <strong>[Sequence]</strong> Immediately after structural work, once plumbing lines are set.
* <strong>[Key Point]</strong> Continuity is critical. A small crack can lead to total failure (leakage).

> <strong>Liquid Waterproofing:</strong> Cement + waterproofing liquid applied by brush/roller; good for complex shapes. <br> <strong>Membrane Waterproofing:</strong> Urethane/acrylic coating forming a rubber-like film; elastic and crack-resistant.

### Phase 2. Masonry: The Partition
Defines physical <strong>boundaries</strong> in empty space. Blocks/bricks divide rooms and create the first barrier for sound and heat.

* <strong>[Location]</strong> Party walls, interior partitions, PD/AD shafts.
* <strong>[Sequence]</strong> Vertically built along floor marking lines after waterproofing is protected.
* <strong>[Key Point]</strong> Fixes XY coordinates; precision in level and plumb becomes the reference for all finishes.

> <strong>Masonry Construction:</strong> Bricks/blocks bonded with mortar. In modern buildings, mostly used as non‑load‑bearing partitions.

### Phase 3. Fenestration: The Envelope Interface
Defines the <strong>opening</strong> between inside and outside.  
Not just a hole—this is where thermal transmission and airtightness performance are determined.

</div>

* <strong>[Key Point]</strong> Filling the gap between wall and frame determines overall thermal performance.

> <strong>U-value:</strong> Heat transmission through a material; lower values mean better insulation. <br> <strong>Grouting:</strong> Filling the gap between frame and wall with mortar or insulation for airtight sealing.

### Phase 4. Interior: The Visual Surface
The final finish users see and touch. It corrects accumulated errors and applies the material texture.

* <strong>[Location]</strong> Ceilings, walls, floors—visible surfaces.
* <strong>[Sequence]</strong> After MEP/electrical is complete and openings are closed.
* <strong>[Key Point]</strong> Includes carpentry, paint, wallpaper, tile. Small tolerances define spatial quality.

> <strong>Substrate:</strong> Base layer for final finishes (e.g., gypsum board or plaster surface).

## 2. Logic of Thickness

A line in drawings becomes a volume on site. Without finish thickness, real spaces shrink.  
Typical <strong>offset values</strong> include:

### Wall Build-up
Total thickness from structure face to final finish.

| Type | Thickness (Approx.) | Components |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <strong>Plaster finish</strong> | <strong>15 ~ 20mm</strong> | Cement mortar layer |
| <strong>Gypsum partition</strong> | <strong>~19mm + @</strong> | 9.5mm board ×2 (+ furring 30–65mm) |
| <strong>Tile finish</strong> | <strong>25 ~ 30mm</strong> | Tile + adhesive mortar |

* <strong>Insight:</strong> Thicker finishes reduce net usable area.

### Floor Build-up
Total thickness above the slab.

* <strong>Residential radiant floor: ~100–110mm</strong>
    * Bubble concrete (sound/insulation) + screed + finish
* <strong>Commercial (tile): ~30–50mm</strong>
    * Self-leveling + adhesive + tile

> <strong>Screed:</strong> Mortar layer covering heating pipes, leveling the floor, and storing heat.

## 3. Conclusion: Tolerance

Every process has tolerances:

* Structure: <strong>cm-level</strong>
* Windows: <strong>mm-level</strong>
* Furniture/interior: <strong>0.5mm-level</strong>

Finishing reduces rough structural errors step by step to reach human‑scale precision.  
Understanding <strong>material properties</strong> and <strong>thickness</strong> is the first step to treating a building as an information object, not just a shape.
