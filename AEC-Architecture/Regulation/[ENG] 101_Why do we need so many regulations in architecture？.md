<p align="center">not only the people who live inside,</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🏘️ the surrounding neighbors</p>

<p align="center">When constructing a building,</p>
<p align="center">the following elements must be considered together.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🏗️ <strong>Is there a risk of collapse?</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🔥 <strong>Can people evacuate safely in a fire?</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> ☀️ <strong>Does it infringe on sunlight and ventilation of nearby buildings?</strong></p>
<p align="center">These issues are</p>

<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 💰 <strong>Relaxed safety standards</strong> to cut costs</p>
