# 2. Why are there so many building regulations?

When you start studying building regulations, the first confusing point is this.

The question, **“Why are there so many laws to refer to?”**

This is because architecture **is not an activity managed by only one law**.

---

## 2-1 A common misunderstanding

Many people

👉 *think all laws related to architecture are simply called the “Building Act.”*

But in reality, architecture

**is managed by multiple laws that divide their roles.**

---

## 2-2 What does the Building Act cover?

The **Building Act** literally

👉 is the law that focuses on **the building itself**.

Its main contents include:

- 🏢 the **scale** of the building
- 📏 **height**
- 🦺 **structural · safety standards**
- 🚪 **evacuation and disaster-prevention plans**

In other words,

it presents standards for **“how to build this building.”**

---

## 2-3 Then, can we build on this land?

On the other hand,

👉 **what kind of building can be built on which land**

is determined not by the Building Act but by **urban · national land-related laws**.

These laws manage the overall order and direction of the city.

- 🏠 residential zones
- 🏬 commercial zones
- 🏭 industrial zones

Depending on the area,

👉 **the types and scale of allowed buildings vary.**

> 💡 You can summarize it like this
> 
> - **Building Act** → *How should we build?*
> - **Urban · national land-related laws** → *Is it allowed to build here?*

---

## 2-4 Other criteria that also apply

It doesn’t stop there.

Architecture also applies the following **specialized laws and standards**.

- 🔥 **Fire safety**: Can people evacuate safely in a fire?
- 🚗 **Parking**: Is there enough space to accommodate vehicles?
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Can everyone use the building without inconvenience?

Each item is

👉 managed through **dedicated laws and standards**.

---

## 2-5 Why does regulatory review keep increasing?

Architecture is not subject to a single law;

👉 **it is a complex activity where multiple laws and standards operate at once.**

So as the design becomes more detailed,

the number of regulations to review naturally increases.

---

## 2-6 If you understand this structure first

If you first understand the **role structure of regulations**,

the various rules that appear later

👉 begin to look like a systematic system, not random rules.

**One-line summary**

> **Architecture is not governed by a single law, but by multiple laws that simultaneously manage the building, the land, and safety.**
