# About Architecture

Simply put, it refers to the process of planning, designing, and constructing a building or other structure and its outcome. However, architecture is not just referring to this physical construction process, but **comprehensive art** that contains people's convenience and safety, the culture and history of the time, etc.

Architecture is intertwined with many other issues such as culture, engineering, art, industry, technology, environment, economy, life, leisure, traditions, communities, laws and institutions, and publicity. To see the world wider and understand our lives, we need to get to know architecture.

Before we get into a full-scale story, I'd like to look at the terms that are basically used in architecture and the general flow of architecture to contemporary.

# Design Process

The design work and construction process are performed in the following order.

1. **Pre-design / Programming**: Plan design tasks required by the owner in advance because they are necessary for building design orders such as size review, field survey, and design guidelines. 
2. **Schematic Design(SD)**: The plan is approved after reviewing the design concept and basic system of related fields.
3. **Design Development(DD)**: Various reviews are conducted to minimize the possibility of changes in the CD and to specify the contents of the SD. The plan is approved by the owner at this stage.
4. **Construction Documents(CD)**: Create plans (including specifications) with construction in mind.
5. **Construction**  
6. **Post-Occupancy Evaluation(POE)**: This is the stage of evaluating the complecated building after using it.

# Building Line

<img src="01_img/line.png" style="width:70%;">

An building line refers to the road boundaries that can be built.
In the case of a wide road, the boundary line between the land and the road becomes the building line, but in the case of a narrow width of the road, the line with 1/2 of the required width (usually 4M) from the centerline of the road becomes the building line.

<img src="01_img/line2.png" style="width:70%;">

Land located at the corner of the road less than 8 m wide also designates building lines at the corner of the road.
In the corner, a certain distance is retreated to both sides according to the prescribed distance for each width of the road, and the line connecting the two points is designated as the building line.

# Area terminology

<img src="01_img/mass.png" style="width:70%;">

## Building area
Building area refers to the area that covers the floor when you look at a building built on the ground from above.

## Gross Floor Area (GFA)
The total floor area of the building on the site is GFA. Literally, it is calculated by combining all floor areas, and this floor area is a measure of real estate value when a building is purchased or built.
However, since the GFA is calculated with the shared part (steps or corridors) and part of the wall together, it is necessary to match the plans to calculate the more detailed area.

## Site Area
Site area refers to the site that can be built. Site area can be equal to or smaller than the site area because it only refers to the area indicated on the building register.

---

# Ratio terminology

## Building Coverage Ratio (BCR)

<img src="01_img/BCR.png" style="width:70%;">

This is the percentage of the building area relative to the site area.
- (building area / site area × 100)

BCR is determined in advance by building regulations according to the region, and it is a very important factor in determining the total area when building a building. BCR is the reason why the building area varies even with the same area of land.

## Floor Area Ratio (FAR)

<img src="01_img/FAR.png" style="width:70%;">

It is the ratio of GFA to the area of the site where the building was built.
- (GFA / site area × 100)

It can be seen as the volume of buildings on the ground. High-rise buildings, such as urban areas, have a high floor area ratio, and in forests and rural areas, the floor area ratio is low.

Both the BCR and the FAR vary depending on the purpose of the area, and the purpose of the site is determined by building laws. The building law restricts the overcrowding of buildings and environmental considerations by reflecting the upper limit of the BCR and the FAR in consideration of regional characteristics.

# Structure and Document terminology

## Load-bearing wall
It is a structurally significant wall that supports the load on the roof of a building or the upper floor and transmits it downstairs, which is a key component of the building's skeleton. It is usually made of concrete or blocks, and it serves to ensure the stability of the building along with the pillars, so it should not be demolished arbitrarily, and it is a main structural parts under construction law.

## Design Documents
It refers to the construction drawings for building works, structural calculation reports, specifications, and other related documents concerning the construction of a building.
Although it can be confused with design drawings, **design documents are a broader concept that encompasses drawings**, while **design drawings are just one type of design document**—so they are different concepts.


## Specification
In the design drawing, matters regarding the performance and material of materials that cannot be specifically indicated are indicated.  
In addition, it describes quality control, safety management, and environmental management, such as construction methods, performance standards and construction methods of materials, and quality tests and inspections.

## Order of precedence for design documents
When the contents of the design documents, interpretations of applicable laws/regulations, or the supervisor’s/inspector’s instructions do not match, construction is typically carried out by giving priority in the following order:

1. Construction Specifications 
2. Design Drawings
3. Special Specifications 
4. Standard Specifications
5. Bill of Quantities (BOQ)
6. Approved Detail Drawing
7. Interpretation of Relevant Laws and Regulations  
8. Supervisor’s/Inspector’s Instructions

# History of Architecture

Architecture has changed a lot over a long period of time, starting with structures such as huts to make space for human life since the prehistoric era. Through these times, architecture has grown together reflecting the technological, cultural, and social changes of society.

The history of architecture is a mirror that contains the technology, art, society, culture, religion, and politics of each period, and is an important key to understanding the development process of human civilization.

Knowing about architecture requires a simple understanding of the flow of architecture and prior knowledge of what, how, and why it has changed.

## Ancient: Mesopotamia, Egypt

Mesopotamia and Egypt are some of the world's top five ancient architectural cultures.
Mesopotamia was mainly built around a middle pavilion (an external exposure space located between buildings in the house) using soil, and religious structures such as temples were developed.
Egypt, on the other hand, used simple structures of soil and stone to create huge structures with tomb construction. In particular, the general form is the slope in which the sides of the lower side are large and narrow as they go up like pyramids.

The most representative structures of Mesopotamia and Egypt are the Ziggurat and the Pyramids. The two structures have great differences in many ways.

<img src="01_img/zigg-pyr.png" style="width:100%;">

| Category | Ziggurat | Pyramids |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interior | Solid mass (filled) | Burial chamber |
| Function | Observatory, altar | Tomb |
| Orientation | Corners aligned with the cardinal directions (E/W/S/N) | Faces aligned with the cardinal directions (E/W/S/N) |
| Material | Mud bricks | Stone |

## Classical: Greece

Greek architecture is the foundation of Western architecture. They were obsessed with perfect proportion and worked hard to achieve harmony, balance, and pursuit of ideal beauty. The temple, in the form of furniture composed of columns and beams, was designed as part of an open civic life. One of the most representative structures is the Parthenon.

<img src="01_img/greece.jpg" style="width:40%;">

In Greece, the order style, a key constituent principle of classical architecture, was used. As this main character played a structural role, the use of arches was extremely rare in Greece.

<img src="01_img/order.png" style="width:40%;">

---

## Classical: Rome

The architecture of Rome was characterized by its Greek architecture design and the absorption of Etruria architecture using arches. The buildings are large and colorful, and the facilities that make up the city have diversified. They also mixed volcanic ash, lime, and gravel to make concrete and use it. 
The Pantheon is the representative structure of Rome.

<img src="01_img/pantheon.jpg" style="width:40%;">

Rome used five orders by changing three Greek orders and adding two. Also, the order was used as a decorative element, with arches and bolts acting as real structural elements. 

---

## Medieval: Early Christianity

From the Medieval, architecture starts to revolve around the church. 
The construction activity was a continuation of Roman architecture, with church architecture being vigorous, but general architecture was sluggish, and there were no new techniques in structure and style.

<img src="01_img/basilica.png" style="width:40%;">

The typical style of early Christianity is the basilica church, which is a church that was built in accordance with the format of the basilica, which was the Roman court. This continued to develop in accordance with the Christian ideology and became the basis for the Gothic style.
Representative examples include Old St. Peter’s Basilica, the Basilica of San Lorenzo, and the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.

---

## Medieval: Byzantine

Byzantine architecture was based on Roman architecture that absorbed Greek culture, incorporating Persian architecture and oriental elements. One of the most prominent structures is the Hagia Sophia.

<img src="01_img/PENDENTIVE.png" style="width:40%;">

In Byzantine architecture, builders developed a structural method for constructing a central dome by using pendentives—triangular curved surfaces formed between adjacent piers and semicircular arches over a square plan.
Structurally, the piers support the arches, and impost blocks were used as the supporting element at the top: the upper part of a double capital, serving as a base that carries the arch.

---

## Medieval: Romanesque

Romanesque is an architecture that reflects Germanic elements in Roman architectural techniques. It's in transition before the Gothic was settled.

<img src="01_img/ratincross.png" style="width:40%;">

In Romanesque architecture, the development of the basilica plan led to the emergence of the Latin-cross plan. Structurally, round (semicircular) arches were used, and as arch construction advanced, groin vaults came into use. The stained glass that most people associate with cathedrals originated in this period, and wall paintings (frescoes) were widely used.

---

## Medieval: Gothic

Gothic architecture transferred religious beliefs and ideas to architecture with a view to architectural perfection as it handled the Romanesque more strictly. Gothic has the advantage of being able to freely use stone by utilizing advanced stonemasoning techniques so that its structure can be constructed reasonably. Myeongdong Cathedral in Korea is also a Gothic cathedral.

<img src="01_img/gothic.png" style="width:40%;">

Gothic architecture is characterized by pointed arches, rib vaults, spires, and flying buttresses. It rationally reflects the religious belief and ideology of aspiring toward the heavens by making vertical lines the main design element (suppressing horizontal articulation and emphasizing vertical articulation). These vertical lines are an important factor that distinguishes between church architectural design and general architecture in Gothic period. In addition, as these structural features allowed the openings in the main walls to expand, ornate rose windows came into widespread use.

---

## Modern: Renaissance

The Renaissance began with the construction of the dome addition to Florence Cathedral. The term Renaissance means “rebirth,” and it involved a renewed pursuit of the classical formal beauty of ancient Greece and Rome. Building on Roman, architects developed a new style that freely and creatively employed classical elements such as domes and orders. They also pursued the concepts and principles of proportion and harmony, and—unlike Gothic architecture—emphasized horizontal lines, highlighting humanity’s social nature and a more secular character.

<img src="01_img/florence-cathedral.jpg" style="width:40%;">

Renaissance dome construction methods were inherited from the Byzantine style, and a key feature was the use of a tall drum and windows to bring in more daylight. When the exterior wall was designed with multiple stories, horizontal string courses were used at each level to emphasize horizontality. In both plan layout and façade composition, Renaissance architecture placed great importance on proportion and symmetry.

---

## Modern: Baroque

Baroque means deterioration or eccentricity, a style that emerged as the Renaissance style declined and changed. Baroque is an architecture focused on public life, such as religion and power, and is characterized by its grand scale, great decorations, and sensibility.

<img src="01_img/baroque.jpg" style="width:40%;">

Baroque architecture sought a total artistic effect by combining painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts with architecture. As a result, curves, undulating walls, a preference for oval wall surfaces, and flamboyant ornamental elements were widely used, synthesizing contrasts such as space and mass, movement and stillness, light and shadow, projection and recession, and large and small. It also produced exaggerated perspectival effects, and there was a strong interplay between horizontal and vertical elements.

---

## Modern: Rococo

Rococo originated in French decoration, taking its name from the shell-like curves and exposed sinuous forms often seen in ornamental motifs. It is a style focused mainly on interior design, creating intimate and beautifully decorated private spaces. Rather than developing distinctive structural features, Rococo advanced primarily in its decorative aspects, and it is characterized by an emphasis on individual privacy.

<img src="01_img/rococo.jpg" style="width:40%;">

---

## Transition: Neoclassicism

It is an architectural style that emerged in the first half of the 18th century from a movement to accurately reproduce classical (Greek and Roman) architecture. As a reaction against the ornate Rococo style, Neoclassicism is characterized by minimized decoration and taller columns.

<img src="01_img/the-white-house.jpg" style="width:40%;">

---

## Transition: Romanticism

Romanticism is an architectural movement that began in England as a reaction against Neoclassicism. It embodies vernacularism (regionalism), populism, and medievalism, and it sought to address the challenges of a new era by drawing on Gothic architecture.

<img src="01_img/big-ben.jpg" style="width:40%;">

---

## Transition: Eclecticism

Because it blended Neoclassicism and Romanticism, it came to be called Eclecticism. Rather than adhering to a single style, eclectic architects prioritized artistic freedom and creativity. As a result, freely drawing from styles such as the Renaissance, Baroque, and Rococo, Eclecticism gave rise to a wide variety of architectural expressions.

# Modern & Contemporary: Architectural Movements

From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the Industrial Revolution and the growth of civil society led to criticism of traditional formalism. New architectural trends emerged that emphasized technology (such as reinforced concrete), functionalism, and rationality, and many architectural movements arose. Below are some representative examples:

1. **Arts and Crafts Movement**: A movement that rejected machine production and advocated a return to craftsmanship. Through simple forms and the use of unadorned linear designs, it foreshadowed Modernism. A representive example is the Red House by William Morris, the founder of the Arts and Crafts Movement.
2. **Art Nouveau**: Emerging in the late 19th century, Art Nouveau literally means “new art.” Its most distinctive feature is the use of organic curves inspired by nature. Art Nouveau architects actively adopted new materials such as iron and glass, moving away from rigid, straight-lined architecture to create softer, more fluid forms. A representive work is Casa Milà by Antoni Gaudí.
3. **Chicago School**: After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which destroyed many stone and timber buildings, the city’s rapid reconstruction led to the development of a typical office-building model using steel frames, high-rise construction, and elevators. A well-known example of Chicago School architecture is the Guggenheim Museum by Frank Lloyd Wright.
4. **Bauhaus**: In 1919, Walter Gropius merged an art school and a crafts school in Weimar and named it the State Bauhaus, contributing to the spread of modern architecture.
5. **CIAM**: A key driving organization of the modern architectural movement, CIAM encouraged free and active exchange among architects from different countries and helped disseminate functionalist and rationalist architecture with a strong international character. However, it was dissolved by radical members around the end of the 10th congress.

# Contemporary

Contemporary architecture shows a wide range of tendencies. Here, only a few of the major trends are introduced.

1. **Modernist Architecture**: It is based on the principle that “form follows function.” In other words, a building’s shape should be designed to suit its purpose. Modernist architects removed unnecessary ornament and pursued simple, geometric forms. In particular, the active use of reinforced concrete and glass made it possible to create taller buildings and wider open spaces. In Korea, buildings such as the 63 Building and COEX Mall were influenced by Modernism. 
2. **Postmodernism**: Postmodernism emerged as a reaction against Modernism. A key characteristic of this style is the eclectic mixing of historical elements with contemporary ones.
3. **Late Modernism**: Unlike Postmodernism, this approach holds that modern architectural ideas did not end but have continued and evolved.
4. **Regionalism**: An architectural tendency that aims for designs suited to the local environment, responding to region-specific conditions such as climate, technology, culture, and available resources.
5. **High-Tech Architecture**: High-tech architecture emphasizes advanced technology and engineering, typically using metal and glass and openly exposing the building’s structure and service systems.
6. **Deconstructivism**: A branch of Postmodern architecture that rejects traditional order—such as harmony, symmetry, balance, and conventional functionality—and instead expresses tension and dynamism through fragmentation, irregular forms, and asymmetry.

# Contemporary: Eco-Friendly Architecture

In recent years, as environmental issues have become a major concern, sustainable (eco-friendly) architecture has gained increasing attention. This approach places the highest priority on energy efficiency and sustainability.

Common trends in sustainable architecture include:

- Making use of daylighting and natural ventilation systems 
- Using renewable and environmentally friendly materials
- Creating green spaces such as rooftop gardens and green walls
- Utilizing renewable energy technologies such as solar panels and geothermal systems

As sustainable architecture becomes more prominent, green building certification systems are also becoming more widespread.

- **LEED**: A rating system for new and existing buildings developed under the leadership of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).
- **G-SEED**: Korea’s green building certification system. Under certification criteria jointly established and announced by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and the Ministry of Environment (MOE), buildings are classified into four rating levels.
