<h1 align="center">2. Why are there so many building regulations?</h1>

<p align="center">When you start studying building regulations, the first confusing point is this:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>“Why are there so many laws to refer to?”</strong></p>
<p align="center">This is because architecture <strong>is not an activity managed by only one law</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">2-1 A common misunderstanding</h2>
<p align="center">Many people</p>
<p align="center">👉 <em>think all laws related to architecture are simply called the “Building Act.”</em></p>
<p align="center">But in reality, architecture</p>
<p align="center"><strong>is managed by multiple laws that divide their roles.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">2-2 What does the Building Act cover?</h2>
<p align="center">The <strong>Building Act</strong> literally</p>
<p align="center">👉 is the law that focuses on <strong>the building itself</strong>.</p>
<p align="center">Its main contents include:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🏢 the <strong>scale</strong> of the building</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 📏 <strong>height</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🦺 <strong>structural · safety standards</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🚪 <strong>evacuation and disaster-prevention plans</strong></p>
<p align="center">In other words,</p>
<p align="center">it presents standards for <strong>“how to build this building.”</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">2-3 Then, can we build on this land?</h2>
<p align="center">On the other hand,</p>
<p align="center">👉 <strong>what kind of building can be built on which land</strong></p>
<p align="center">is determined not by the Building Act but by <strong>urban · national land-related laws</strong>.</p>
<p align="center">These laws manage the overall order and direction of the city.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🏠 residential zones</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🏬 commercial zones</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🏭 industrial zones</p>
<p align="center">Depending on the area,</p>
<p align="center">👉 <strong>the types and scale of allowed buildings vary.</strong></p>

<p align="center">&gt; 💡 You can summarize it like this</p>
<p align="center">&gt; <strong>-</strong> <strong>Building Act</strong> → <em>How should we build?</em></p>
<p align="center">&gt; <strong>-</strong> <strong>Urban · national land-related laws</strong> → <em>Is it allowed to build here?</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">2-4 Other criteria that also apply</h2>
<p align="center">It doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p align="center">Architecture is also subject to the following <strong>specialized laws and standards</strong>.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🔥 <strong>Fire safety</strong>: Can people evacuate safely in a fire?</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> 🚗 <strong>Parking</strong>: Is there enough space to accommodate vehicles?</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> ♿ <strong>Accessibility</strong>: Can everyone use the building without inconvenience?</p>
<p align="center">Each item is</p>
<p align="center">👉 managed through <strong>dedicated laws and standards</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">2-5 Why does regulatory review keep increasing?</h2>
<p align="center">Architecture is not subject to a single law;</p>
<p align="center">👉 <strong>it is a complex activity where multiple laws and standards operate at once.</strong></p>
<p align="center">So as the design becomes more detailed,</p>
<p align="center">the number of regulations to review naturally increases.</p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">2-6 If you understand this structure first</h2>
<p align="center">If you first understand the <strong>role structure of regulations</strong>,</p>
<p align="center">the various rules that appear later</p>
<p align="center">👉 begin to look systematic rather than random.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>One-line summary</strong></p>
<p align="center">&gt; <strong>Architecture is not governed by a single law, but by multiple laws that simultaneously manage the building, the land, and safety.</strong></p>
