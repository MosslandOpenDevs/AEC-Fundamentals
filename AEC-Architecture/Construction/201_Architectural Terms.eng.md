## Construction Terms You Can Use to Sound Knowledgeable on Site

## 1. Coupler

A coupler is a **connecting component that joins pieces of rebar together**. In the past, rebar was commonly connected by overlapping pieces for a certain length (lap splice), but this is difficult in tight spaces or where rebar is densely concentrated. Using a coupler allows the rebar ends to be threaded together for a clean connection.

> 💡 Couplers can reduce lap splice length, minimize construction errors, and are advantageous for precise alignment according to drawings.

## 2. Konguri (Slang for Concrete)
<img src="./201_img/Generated Image February 09, 2026 - 4_43PM.jpeg" width="66%">

Konguri is **slang used on site to refer to concrete**. It is a word that originated during the Japanese colonial era and remains in use today. When someone says "We're pouring konguri today," it generally means they are placing and compacting concrete. Since major structural elements like floors, walls, columns, and slabs are mostly made of concrete, this term comes up very frequently.

> 💡 In official documents, it is written as "concrete placement," but in on-site conversations, the expression "konguri" is used more naturally.

---

## 3. Construction Period (Gonggi)

Construction period refers to the **total duration required for construction**. "The construction period is tight" means there isn't enough time, and "The construction period has been extended" means the completion date has been pushed back. When the construction period is extended, costs such as labor, equipment, and rental often increase as well.

> 💡 Schedule management is just as important as quality and safety on site. Proper management of the construction period helps maintain construction quality, cost control, and client trust.

## 4. Ramp

A ramp is an **inclined passageway that allows vehicles or equipment to navigate elevation changes**. The easiest way to understand it is to think of an underground parking garage entrance. Stairs are for people, and ramps are for vehicles and transport equipment.

> 💡 During design, slope gradient, width, turning radius, and drainage are all considered together to ensure convenience and safety.

---

## 5. Tarpaulin
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%201_07PM.jpeg" width="66%">

A tarpaulin is a **thick, durable waterproof sheet (protective cover)**. Think of the blue waterproof sheets commonly seen around construction sites. It is frequently used on site to protect materials and work surfaces from rain, dust, and contamination.

> 💡 Because construction sites are heavily affected by weather and dust, protective materials like tarpaulins play a major role in maintaining quality.

---

## 6. Formwork
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%201_09PM.jpeg" width="66%">

Formwork is the **process of installing and dismantling molds (forms) to shape concrete into the desired form**. Since concrete initially flows like a liquid, a mold is essential to hold its shape until it hardens.

> 💡 If the formwork is misaligned, the structure can also become misaligned, leading to quality issues. Formwork is both the foundation and the core process of structural construction.

---

## 7. Material Sorting
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%201_18PM.jpeg" width="66%">

Material sorting is the **task of separating and managing waste and leftover materials from the site by type**. Sorting wood, metal, concrete debris, packaging, and other materials without mixing them increases the recycling rate and reduces disposal costs.

> 💡 This is not just simple cleaning but a fundamental operational practice that manages cost, safety, and the environment simultaneously.

---

## 8. Sump Pit
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%201_21PM.jpeg" width="66%">

A sump pit is a **small collection basin that gathers water from the floor or underground into one location**. The floor is sloped so water flows naturally into the pit, and the collected water is then pumped out.

> 💡 Basements are at risk of rainwater and groundwater intrusion, making sump pits and drainage pumps very important. Regular inspection, cleaning, and pump status checks are essential maintenance points.

---

## 9. Aggregate
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%201_29PM.jpeg" width="66%">

Aggregate refers to **granular materials like sand and gravel that serve as the skeleton of concrete**. Cement and water alone cannot produce strong concrete; aggregate must be added to ensure strength and stability.

> 💡 Concrete quality varies significantly depending on the aggregate's size distribution (gradation), cleanliness, and moisture content. Aggregate is a basic material yet is managed very strictly.

---

## 10. Parapet
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%201_53PM.jpeg" width="66%">

A parapet is a **low wall built along the edge of a rooftop**. Its primary function is to prevent falls, and it also serves to visually define the upper profile of the building.

> 💡 Since parapets are directly exposed to wind and rain, and are located at the boundary where the rooftop waterproofing layer meets the exterior wall finish, they are detail areas prone to cracking and water leakage.

---

## 11. Boom
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%202_06PM.jpeg" width="66%">

A boom is the **long extending arm on a pump truck or crane**. It plays a key role in delivering concrete to distant locations or lifting materials to high places.

> 💡 Before boom operations, route planning, ground condition verification, and signal coordination are essential.

---

## 12. Scaffolding
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%202_10PM.jpeg" width="66%">

Scaffolding is a **temporary platform structure installed for safe work at heights**. It is nearly essential for elevated work such as exterior finishing, painting, window installation, and MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing) work.

> 💡 Failure to follow standards for guardrails, toe boards, fastening, and load limits can lead to serious accidents. Compliance with installation standards and regular inspections are absolutely necessary.

---

## 13. Shop Drawing

A shop drawing is a **more detailed drawing created by the contractor or manufacturer based on the design drawings, specifically for fabrication and installation**. Design drawings provide direction and standards, while shop drawings specify dimensions, joint methods, and member sequencing so that components can be fabricated directly on site.

> 💡 Shop drawings are especially important for steel, metal, curtain wall, and carpentry work. Insufficient review of shop drawings can lead to on-site conflicts and rework, increasing both schedule and cost.

---

## 14. Canopy
<img src="./201_img/Generated%20Image%20February%2009,%202026%20-%202_25PM.jpeg" width="66%">

A canopy is a **shade structure that covers entrances or outdoor pedestrian pathways**. It blocks rain, snow, and strong sunlight to improve entry convenience and helps reduce safety incidents like slipping.

> 💡 It is not just functional but also a design element that creates the first impression of a building. Even though it may look like a small structure, it has a significant impact on user experience and maintenance quality.
