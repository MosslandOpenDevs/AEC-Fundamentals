# 1. Why do we need building regulations?

People who encounter building regulations for the first time often think like this.

**“Why is it so complicated?”**,

**“If I want to build, can’t I just build?”**

These questions are very natural.

## 1-1 Is architecture just a personal matter?

However, architecture is

not merely **an act of creating private property**.

A single building affects

not only the people who live inside,

- 🏘️ the surrounding neighbors
- 🛣️ adjacent roads
- 🌆 and even the entire city

as well.

## 1-2 Issues we must consider together

When constructing a building,

the following elements must be considered together.

- 🏗️ **Is there a risk of collapse?**
- 🔥 **Can people evacuate safely in a fire?**
- ☀️ **Does it infringe on sunlight and ventilation of nearby buildings?**

These issues are

👉 **not something we can leave to individual judgment alone.**

---

## 1-3 That’s why laws became necessary

For these reasons, society has long recognized

building as **an activity that requires management, not complete freedom**.

As a result,

👉 **building regulations were created.**

> 💡 The essence of building regulations
> 
> Building regulations
> 
> are less about forcing “build like this,”
> 
> and closer to **a minimum standard of “let’s not cross this line.”**

## 1-4 What if there were no building regulations?

If building regulations did not exist,

what would happen?

- 📐 **Excessive extensions** to secure more floor area
- 💰 **Relaxed safety standards** to cut costs

These choices would likely be repeated.

In the end, the damage would be borne by

👉 **the people who use the buildings and the city as a whole.**

---

## 1-5 How to view building regulations

For these reasons, building regulations

are not barriers meant to obstruct architecture,

👉 but **a social safety net that filters risks before accidents happen**.

Once you understand this perspective,

the various regulations that follow

start to look completely different.

**One-line summary**

> **Building regulations are not rules to restrict buildings, but the minimum standards to protect people and cities.**
