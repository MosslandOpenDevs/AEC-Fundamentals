# Power, Fire Safety & Gas Systems

### Understanding supply flow, alarm logic, and safety infrastructure

</div>

<br>

## 1. Overview

Electrical, communications, fire protection, and gas systems define building safety and operational reliability.  
This document summarizes the <strong>flow structure</strong>, <strong>space planning</strong>, <strong>placement rules</strong>, and <strong>safety criteria</strong>.

## 2. Electrical & Communications Systems

### 2.1 Power Flow

Typical power flow follows this sequence:

1. <strong>Utility / Substation</strong>  
2. <strong>MSB (Main Switchboard)</strong>  
3. <strong>SDB (Sub Distribution Board)</strong>  
4. <strong>Floor distribution → End loads (lighting, outlets, equipment)</strong>

> <strong>Key Point:</strong> Power distribution follows a “top → down” hierarchy with protective devices at each stage.

### 2.2 EPS / TPS Rooms

* <strong>EPS (Electrical Power System) Room:</strong> central space for switchboards, transformers, UPS, and power equipment  
* <strong>TPS (Telecommunication Power System) Room:</strong> central space for server racks and communication distribution  

<strong>Space Planning Principles</strong>
* Provide front/back maintenance clearance
* Address heat dissipation and ventilation
* Secure fire separation and equipment clearances

### 2.3 Cable Tray Coordination

* Trays frequently clash with structure, MEP systems, and ceiling finishes.
* Tray width, bend radius, and access clearance should be checked early.
* To reduce EMI, power and communication lines should be <strong>horizontally separated</strong> or <strong>segregated with barriers</strong>.

## 3. Fire Protection Systems

### 3.1 Sprinkler Systems

* <strong>Wet:</strong> piping filled with water at all times; most common
* <strong>Dry:</strong> used in freezing-risk zones; air released before water supply
* <strong>Preaction:</strong> prevents false activation; used for sensitive facilities

<strong>Placement Principles</strong>
* Coordinate with ceiling finish heights and lighting
* Avoid overlap or gaps in detection coverage
* Maintain code-based spacing and discharge radius

### 3.2 Detection & Alarm

* <strong>Smoke</strong>, <strong>heat</strong>, and <strong>multi-criteria</strong> detectors
* Manual call points and alarms along egress routes

<strong>Design Considerations</strong>
* Ensure alignment with ceiling layout
* Maintain visibility and maintenance access

## 4. Gas Systems

### 4.1 Supply Flow

1. <strong>Gas service entry</strong>  
2. <strong>Meter and regulator</strong>  
3. <strong>Horizontal/vertical piping</strong>  
4. <strong>End equipment (boilers, kitchen appliances)</strong>

### 4.2 Safety Criteria

* Place <strong>shut-off valves</strong> in accessible locations
* Route piping in ventilated or serviceable areas
* Coordinate <strong>leak detection</strong> with ventilation
* Keep safe separation from ignition sources and high-heat equipment

---

## 5. Quick Review

* <strong>Electrical:</strong> confirm protections by distribution stage; EPS/TPS access clearances  
* <strong>Communications:</strong> tray segregation and ventilation in telecom rooms  
* <strong>Fire:</strong> sprinkler spacing and detector placement coordination  
* <strong>Gas:</strong> shut-off valves, leak detection, and ventilation linkage

## 6. Summary

Electrical, fire protection, and gas systems are critical for <strong>safety, operations, and maintenance</strong>.  
Clarifying spatial requirements, clash points, and placement rules early improves system reliability and reduces downstream risk.
