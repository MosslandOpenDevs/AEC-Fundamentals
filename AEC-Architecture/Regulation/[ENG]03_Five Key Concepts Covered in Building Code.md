<h1 align="center">3. Five key concepts covered by the Building Act</h1>

<p align="center">When you first encounter building regulations, the biggest roadblock is <strong>unfamiliar terms</strong>.</p>
<p align="center">Concepts like building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and setback distances feel even harder because they come with numbers.</p>
<p align="center">But these concepts are not <strong>rules to memorize</strong>;</p>
<p align="center">👉 it’s important to understand them as <strong>minimum standards for managing building activity</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">Key concept 1️⃣ Site (Lot)</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Building regulations <strong>always start from the “site.”</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> No matter how well a building is designed,</p>
<p align="center">👉 <strong>if the site conditions don’t match, construction itself becomes impossible</strong>.</p>

<h3 align="center">Why is it important?</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> The site’s <strong>area, shape, and relationship to roads</strong></p>
<p align="center">👉 become the basis for all later regulatory judgments.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> In other words, if you start by understanding the land,</p>
<p align="center">👉 <strong>you’re already halfway done</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">Key concept 2️⃣ Building coverage ratio</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="assets/images/03-2_ENG.jpg" alt="Building coverage ratio" /></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> <strong>Building coverage ratio</strong> means</p>
<p align="center">👉 the <strong>percentage of the site area occupied by the building footprint</strong>.</p>

<h3 align="center">Put simply</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> It is the standard that decides <strong>“how much of this land can be covered by a building.”</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">Key concept 3️⃣ Floor area ratio</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="assets/images/03-3_ENG.jpg" alt="Floor area ratio" /></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> <strong>Floor area ratio</strong> means</p>
<p align="center">👉 the ratio of the building’s <strong>total gross floor area</strong> to the site area.</p>

<h3 align="center">Difference from building coverage ratio</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> <strong>Building coverage ratio</strong> → how much of the land you cover</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> <strong>Floor area ratio</strong> → how much you can stack upward</p>

<h3 align="center">Why is it needed?</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> It prevents <strong>overly dense buildings</strong> on a single lot.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> It is a key standard for controlling the density and scale of the city.</p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">Key concept 4️⃣ Height limit · Floor count limit</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> If the height limit is in <strong>meters (m)</strong>, the floor limit decides <strong>how many floors can be stacked</strong>.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> If all buildings could rise without limits,</p>
<p align="center">👉 the urban environment would quickly deteriorate.</p>

<h3 align="center">Typical example</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Height limit: the <strong>daylight plane restriction</strong>. Simply put, it is a rule that requires cutting back the upper part of a building to minimize the shadow it casts on a neighbor’s yard or window.</p>

<h3 align="center">The role of this standard</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Managing the city’s <strong>skyline</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Maintaining <strong>daylight, views, and openness</strong> in residential environments</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Adjusting <strong>scale</strong> with surrounding areas</p>
<p align="center">👉 It is not merely a “blocking rule,”</p>
<p align="center"><strong>but a mechanism to preserve the overall quality of the city</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 align="center">Key concept 5️⃣ Setbacks · Daylighting · Sunlight</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> <strong>Setback distance:</strong> keeping the building a certain distance away from the site boundary or neighboring buildings.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> <strong>Daylighting:</strong> letting sunlight into interiors; the Building Act requires a minimum window area for spaces where people stay long, like living rooms or bedrooms.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> <strong>Sunlight access:</strong> the fundamental reason for the “height limit” described above. It is the right to receive sunlight without harming others.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> These standards strongly aim to <strong>protect neighbors rather than the building owner</strong>.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Setback distance, daylighting, and sunlight rights are specified in the Building Act and its subordinate decree (the Enforcement Decree of the Building Act).</p>

<h3 align="center">Included concepts</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Securing <strong>distance between buildings</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Managing so that <strong>sunlight and wind are not blocked</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Guaranteeing <strong>minimum comfort</strong> in residential spaces</p>

<h3 align="center">Key point</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>-</strong> Architecture is private property, but</p>
<p align="center">👉 <strong>the urban environment belongs to everyone</strong>.</p>
